# AnyGPT your own ChatGPT Clone for Free on Colab in under 10 minutes
This repository provides a setup for a ChatGPT-like interface for Large Language Models (LLMs) on Google Colab using Ollama and a user interface (UI).

This supports the article "Launch Your Own ChatGPT Clone for Free on Colab: Shareable and Online in less than 10 Minutes" by Bartek Lewicz (https://medium.com/@bartek.lewicz/launch-your-own-chatgpt-clone-for-free-on-colab-shareable-and-online-in-less-than-10-minutes-da19e44be5eb).

## Functionality:

Leverages Ollama to run LLMs locally on Google Colab's free tier.
Employs a user interface similar to ChatGPT for interacting with the LLM.
Allows downloading various LLM models directly through the interface.
Exposes the UI to the internet using Localtunnel for easy access.
Getting Started:

## Requirements:

Google Account
Familiarity with Google Colab

## Instructions:
The detailed instructions for setup and usage are provided in the included Jupyter Notebook (ChatGPT_Colab_Ollama.ipynb).

## Considerations:

Google Colab free tier limitations apply (runtime, sessions, resource usage).
This approach is intended for experimentation and development, not production environments.
